Title "Addition"

Introduction
"
Peano defined addition `a + b` by induction on `b`, or,
more precisely, by *recursion* on `b`. He first explained how to add 0 to a number:
this is the base case.

* `add_zero (a : ℕ) : a + 0 = a`

We will call this theorem `add_zero`. It has just appeared in your inventory!
Mathematicians sometimes call it \"Lemma 2.1\" or \"Hypothesis P6\" or something. But
computer scientists call it `add_zero` because it tells you
what the answer to \"$x$ add zero\" is. It's a *much* better name than \"Lemma 2.1\".
Even better, we can use the rewrite tactic with `add_zero`.
If you ever see `x + 0` in your goal, `rewrite [add_zero]` will simplify it to `x`.
This is because `add_zero` is a proof that `x + 0 = x` (more precisely,
`add_zero x` is a proof that `x + 0 = x` but Lean can figure out the `x` from the context).

Now here's the inductive step. If you know how to add `d` to `a`, then
Peano tells you how to add `succ(d)` to `a`. It looks like this:

* `add_succ (a d : ℕ) : a + succ(d) = succ (a + d)`

What's going on here is that we assume `a + d` is already
defined, and we define `a + succ(d)` to be the number after it.
This is also in your inventory now -- `add_succ` tells you
how to add a successor to something. If you ever see `... + succ ...`
in your goal, you should be able to use `rewrite [add_succ]` to make
progress. Here is a simple example where we shall see both. Let's prove
that $x$ add the number after $0$ is the number after $x$.

Observe that the goal mentions `... + succ ...`. So type

`rewrite [add_succ]`

and hit enter; see the goal change.

Do you see that the goal now mentions ` ... + 0 ...`? So type

`rewrite [add_zero]`

and try to finish the level alone from there.

Conclusion "Congratulations for completing your fourth level! This is the end of the tutorial part
of the game. Serious things start in the next level."
